                    It is a period of code war. During the battle with the BeCode Galactic Empire, padawan Ronnie James
                    fell after a long bloody battle with Darth Var and Darth Let. The battle seemed lost at that time.

                    When he was healed, he came back to battle. This time he came face to face with Darth HTML and Darth
                    PHP. No battle was fought that day because the young padawan finally understood their code and
                    agreed to it.

                    He later joined the BeCode Galactic Empire and started to learn more about the SITH code....
